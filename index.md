## ANSWERS TO PROMPTS

### (1) What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter? <br>
I feel that the most interesting topic is the dashboard featuring time series data mentioned in the domain. The reason is that time series data will be central to further data analysis in the Quarter 2 Project, as much of our health data will be presented in this format. Additionally, a dashboard is a great tool to represent this data in an intuitive way.

### (2) Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
For the Quarter 2 Project, the potential investigation will be learning Node.js for web development for our dashboard website. More specifically, I will investigate how to implement a login system that enables users to access their own accounts and view only their personal data.

### (3) What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
A potential change I would make is to first research the API key. We underestimated the difficulty of obtaining data this quarter. After investigating how to access lab data from Vital, a third-party platform that offers cleaned health data from users, we still haven't figured out how to pull those data. So, if I could, I would first focus on getting the data.

### (4) What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
Personally, another interesting topic I find is creating the login system for the website and acquiring health data through a third party's API. The process of setting up the API key to build a data pipeline for automatically uploading data to the server has been intriguing and challenging. However, I believe we can address this in the next quarter. As for the login system, it involves extensive backend development, which will enable me to gain more knowledge about software development.
